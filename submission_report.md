## 2. Portfolio Sections

### A. Security Achievements (`/security`)
**URL:** [https://my-digital-portfolio-alpha.vercel.app/security](https://my-digital-portfolio-alpha.vercel.app/security)

This section serves as the central hub for my security research and findings. It includes:
*   **Executive Security Dashboard:** A real-time visualization of system health, threat analysis, and vulnerability distribution.
*   **Penetration Testing Results:** Detailed reports on recent security assessments, including a "Financial Services App Audit" (High Risk) and a "Healthcare Portal Assessment" (Medium Risk).
*   **Case Studies:** Direct links to the LMS curriculum modules demonstrating the application of learned concepts.

### B. MCP Integration (`/mcp-integration`)
**URL:** [https://my-digital-portfolio-alpha.vercel.app/mcp-integration](https://my-digital-portfolio-alpha.vercel.app/mcp-integration)

This section demonstrates the implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
*   **Interactive Demo:** A live interface allowing users to execute MCP tools (e.g., Network Scan, Secure Dice Roll) in a sandboxed environment.
*   **OAuth 2.1 Flow:** Documentation and visualization of the secure authentication flow used to protect MCP resources.

## 3. Executive Summary of Defenses
Recent penetration testing conducted on the live environment confirmed the effectiveness of the implemented defenses:

*   **Rate Limiting:** Successfully blocked high-frequency requests (DoS simulation) with `429 Too Many Requests`.
*   **Bot Protection:** Detected and blocked requests from automated user agents.
*   **Route Protection:** Prevented unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints like `/admin` and `/api/auth/signin` via automated scanning.
